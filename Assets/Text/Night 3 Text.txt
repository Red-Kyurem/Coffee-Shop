@Night 3@
Night 3 means only 2 more to go.
By this point, you've taken your mental health into consideration, and closed
the store for a bit in order to rest up. You've been working 5 shifts in a row
at this point, and already passed out once.
Reentering the coffee shop and flipping the door sign to read "Open", you're
greeted with a MASSIVE SQUID TENTACLE COMING THROUGH THE FLOOR.
You can tell that this is the same sky kraken that destroyed your previous job
location. How can you tell? Theres still a piece of shrapnel lodged in the
tentacle - a piece of the sign outside Kien's Coffee Shop, with the letter K
from Kien now permanently embededed within the Kraken.
Nonetheless, the Kraken appears extremely calm, and as you approach it turns in
place so that it's "front side" is facing you. You notice a pair of comical
disguise glasses on this side of the tentacle, giving the appearence that the
tentacle has a face.
<name = "???"> "Ah hello there. Might you be one of the employees at this
establishment? I'm simply starving and would very much enjoy one of your
coffees.
<name = ""> You should have figured that it was only here for coffee. After all,
when this exact tentacle was at the previous location, he asked for the same
order. The natural escalation that follows a massive tentacle punching a hole in
the floor and asking for a coffee was really the only reason why the shop was
ripped in half.
You inch around the tentacle to get back behind the counter. Taking a deep
breath, you prepare yourself for the tentacles order. Perhaps not quite
understanding the situation you're in, or from shock, you feel the urge to
question the tentacle.
[["You seem familiar..." |<\BUBBLE>"You seem familiar..."]]
<\BUBBLE>"You seem familiar..."
Upon hearing what you said, the tentacle seems to...sweat?
<name = "???"> "I'm not quite sure I follow. This is the first time I've ever
entered this coffee shop, and as you can tell I'm as generic looking as they
come. Yessir, just good ol Kevin the completely normal human being, who is
definitely not a tentacle.
<name = ""> Right. Anyways you get your notepad out in order to eagerly take
"Kevin"'s order.
<name = "Kevin"> Alright so... uh... could I get a decaf espresso with extra soy
milk. And I do mean EXTRA. Like at least 4 cups added.

<name = ""> Kevin recieves the coffee, retracting into the ground as a very
audible slurping noise is heard from below the shop. He reappears, minus one cup
and holding an extraordinairly small wallet.
<name = "Kevin"> "So.. uh... funny story. I was drinking the coffee you gave me
and - get this - the cup disappeared! Heh... uh... terribly sorry about that.
<name = ""> Replacing the cup on the counter with a new one, you yet again feel
another urge to question Kevin.

<name = ""> Kevin takes the cup, disappearing below the ground before
reappearing with the cup, and his disguise goggles contorted so they look
"angry"
<name = "Kevin"> "Is this some sort of joke?? I'm pretty sure my order was
pretty simple to make. I'm sorry but I can't possibly pay you for this, seeing
as its missing what I asked for.
<name = ""> He pauses for a moment.
<name = "Kevin"> "In fact, I've never liked your attitude this whole time. Even
before you took my order, you implied I was something "inhuman". Frankly, I'm
offended, and I'm leaving.
<name = ""> He disappears once more, reappearing with the goggle even more
contorted.
<name = "Kevin"> "And trust me. I will be back..."
<name = ""> He disappears one final time, as a booming noise is heard below the
shop, and, upon looking down into the hole in the ground, you see that Kevin is
no longer there.
Here's hoping that he didn't mean what he said.

<\BUBBLE>I just noticed where I know you from.
<name = "Kevin"> YOU DO?! I mean... you do?
<name = "You"> "Yeah, you're that tentacle from the old coffee shop."
Kevin slumps for a moment, disappearing beneath the floor and coming back with
his disguise goggles contorted so they look "sad".
<name = "Kevin"> "Yeah... you got me. I'm the same kraken from the incident at
the old coffee shop... But you gotta understand, I didn't MEAN to destroy the
shop. Honest. I'm not stupid, I could tell that my goggles don't fool anybody.
Despite that, Kien's Coffee Shop is talked about so much by you humans, that I
couldn't help but become interested. I guess I got flustered from the sudden
silence that occured when I ordered that I just... flipped out?"
<name = ""> He does seem genuinely sorry about the destruction of the old
branch.
<name = "Kevin"> "I did some thinking about how I should better control my
emotions, even started going in to see this guy, Gramps, whos a therapist...
Anyways, I'm really sorry about what I did, and I'm willing to pay for the
damage, if you'll accept that I'm working to be better.
<name = ""> Without waiting too long for an answer, Kevin disappears under the
floor again, pulling out the money for the coffee and a check for 50 grand to
help with the restoration costs of the old branch. He places them on the
counter, suprisingly delicately, before "looking" at you with his goggles.
<name = "Kevin"> "You know what, I feel way better getting that off my chest.
Thanks for hearing me out."
<name = ""> Kevin takes a bow, before exiting back under the floor.
Definitely gonna be needing to fix that hole, but you feel like you did the
right thing hearing Kevin out.

<\BUBBLE>*decide not to question after all.*
You decide it's better to not "poke the bear" so to speak.
You recieve payment from Kevin, before he disappears looking satisfied.
