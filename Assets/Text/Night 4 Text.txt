<\BUBBLE>START
@Night 4@
Feeling energized, you decide you're well enough to do another shift, so you
buckle down and prepare for Night 4.
The usual late night customers appear, though since most people don't tend to
order coffee in the wee hours of night, there's not much for you to do.
You decide to pass the time by fixating on a particular stain on the counter, of
which you have no idea how it got there. It's color doesn't match any coffee
you've served thus far, and all the machines aren't randomly leaving liquid on
the counter.
Before you can continue with this enthralling new development, the door swings
open and judging from how big the figure is, you have no doubt who it is even
before they step into the light. Felix is back.
<name = "Felix"> "Y...ou th-th-there. This one-ne-ne-ne has rettttterned for
another bevvvvverage."
<name = ""> Felix is in pretty rough shape. The fetus part of Felix is perfectly
fine, in fact it seems incredibly irritated that its mechanical body is
malfunctioning as it is. The mechanical body has definitely seen better days.
One of the body's arms have been ripped off and the singular wheel that it
normally manuveurs with looks like a square.
[["Everything Okay?" |<\BUBBLE>"Everything Okay?"]]
<\BUBBLE>"Everything Okay?"
Felix (the fetus not the body) looks at you with an unamused glare.
<name = "Felix"> "Every-th-th-thing is just PEACHY as you can seeeeeeeee. This
One has simply decided to take his cr-cr-cr-cr-craft for a JOYRIDE, causing
unfixable damage. Nothing to worry your simple MIND ab-about."
<name = ""> Thinking back on it, you probably shouldn't have served caffeine to
a fetus, but hey a customer is a customer. Though, Felix never did pay you
either. Why DID you serve Felix anyways?
<name = "Felix"> "Regardless of this one's current situuuuuation, one cannot
stop oneself from returning for another beverage. Especially when one's escape
pod is fueled pri---marily by beans.
[["Okay...?" |<\BUBBLE>"Okay...?"]]
<\BUBBLE>"Okay...?"
<name = "Felix"> "Wonderful. Well in-in-in-in that case, this one requests your
finest-"
<name = ""> Before Felix is able to give you his order, the speaker he normally
"speaks" from, violently exudes sparks before it powers down. The Fetus lets out
a miriad of bubbles in frustration before producing a wrench somehow and banging
the bottom of its tank.
<name = "Felix"> "DARK....MOCHA... EXTRA 2%"
<name = ""> With those 4 words, the speaker finally gives out. Felix raises one
more defiant wrench slam before ultimately giving up. He then turns in his tank
to look at you with crossed arms. Might as well get the order done so Felix can
repair his body. You recall the machine requesting a Dark Roast, with Mocha and
Extra 2% Milk.

You physically have to pour the drink into Felix since his body is unresponsive.
With the tank mimicking the color of the drink for a couple moments before
returning to normal, Felix looks pleased for a moment, trying to move the metal
body once more. The refuel was much too late unfortunately, as the body
collapses in a heap.
Felix is shocked for a moment, but looks at you with a thankful glance. He then
reequips his wrench and smacks the top of his tank, causing the tank to detach
from the body and produce its propeller once more. Felix flies towards and out
the doors.
You feel like you did the same thing, but now you have this massive scrap heap
you have to sweep away.
Moving towards it to clean it up, you notice the socket where Felix was seated
in his tank is filled with gold coins.
Looks like Felix paid for his drinks after all.

You move forward to pour the drink into Felix's Tank. After dissolving for a
second within the tank, Felix looks at you with a disapointed look. You surmise
you must have messed up the drink in some regards.
Felix produces his wrench once more and smacks a large red button within his
tank. The tank disconnects from the main body and contorts into a smaller ball
form. Felix rolls away towards the door where he waits outside for a moment.
After a couple minutes, it would appear what he was trying to do was hail a Sky
Taxi.
When the taxi arrives, Felix looks back towards you with the same disapointed
look before leaving on the taxi.
You move to clean up the rubble of Felix's body, but before you can, the body
smokes violently and begins melting through the floor.
As it falls through the floor, you catch a glimmer of gold, suggesting that
Felix was intending to pay you for the drinks but changed his mind after you
messed up his drink.
Wonder why the cafe keeps attracting customers that punch holes in the floor...
