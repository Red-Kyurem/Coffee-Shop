It's the last shift at the new branch.
You look around the coffee shop, embedding its appearence into your mind.
While it looks similar to the old branch, there's definitely something unique
about it that makes you a little sad to leave.
You'll even miss the constant holes in the floor from the "customers", as while
they were definitely a hastle to clean up, they gave you a way to kill time
during your shift.
The shop is quiet, and you're surprised to see that nobody has come to see you
off.
You think back to all the people you've met this week.
The Barista, whom you probably inadvertently killed by doing your job, and who's
name you never actually learned.
Felix, who's body you basically destroyed by doing your job.
Gramps, who found Benedict thanks to you.
Benedict, whom is still on the run for tax evasion
Cien, who remains terrified of the letter "K"
and Kevin, who was responsible for your job relocation in the first place.
You're glad to have met these people, even if some did more harm to the world
then good.
You glance at the clock on the wall and notice your shift is coming to a close.
Seems like reminiscing about things eats a lot of time. That, or the narrative
designer wasn't sure how else to end the game.
You decide you're gonna make yourself a coffee before you go.
Let's see. The nightime atmosphere reminds you of Dark Roast, and the moon of
milk, so let's make a Dark Roast blend with mocha and 2% Milk.

You construct your coffee and take a sip.
It's pretty good.
You finish the coffee and head over to the door, flipping the sign over one
final time.
You get on your sky scooter, and begin the long drive back home looking back one
final time...

You taste the coffee you made for yourself and have to stop yourself from
gagging.
Ain't that poetic that the final coffee at his shop wasn't even made right?
Regardless, you feel you'll finish the cup anyways.
You head over to the door, flipping the sign over one final time.
You get on your sky scooter, and begin the long drive back home, not taking the
time to look back...
