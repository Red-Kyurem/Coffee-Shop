<\BUBBLE>Day 5
At long last, it's Day 5. You've done 8 shifts so far, and this is the last day
shift.
By now, you're pretty comfortable running the cafe, and its clear that word is
getting out about the new branch, as there's much more customers now then there
were earlier in the week.
You've cleaned up the remains of Felix at this point, and its almost impossible
to tell that last night even occurred.
After performing morning maintenence on the coffee machines, and tidying up,
you're ready to properly begin today's shift.
Midway into the shift, you hear somebody stumbling outside the cafe, and look to
see that the Barista is back - albeit barely hanging on.
She struggles with opening the door, as if her very limbs aren't cooperating.
Eventually she does manage to open the door, though upon entering the door
swings back and knocks her flat on her face.
You hear a very audible sigh, before she slowly stands back up.
She stumbles towards the counter, before falling towards it, catching herself
and using the counter for balance.
<name = "Barista"> "Hey there Jerry... how're things going here?"
<name = ""> Every word she speaks seems like it takes all of her effort.
<name = "Barista"> "I felt bad about leaving you to your own devices here, so I
thought I'd check in and see how things are working out. Seems like you've
gotten the hang of things?"<choice>
[["Things are going well." |<\BUBBLE>"Things are going well."]]
[["I struggle to perform." |<\BUBBLE>"I struggle to perform."]]
<\BUBBLE>"Things are going well."
<name = ""> A faint smile can be traced across her lips.
<name = "Barista"> "That's really good to hear. I apologize for not mentioning
my allergy to coffee. I know I should have, but theres some sort of
gratification I get from drinking something I know is bad for me. As a result,
you've been alone here for most of the week."
<name = ""> She wobbles for a moment.
<name = "Barista"> "Anyways, I was reading my contract and it turns out that
"mortal illness" isn't a good excuse to take time off. Seeing as you and I are
basically the only employees, and I'd rather not kill myself doing my job in
this state, I'll test you on another drink and then go back home. You seem
pretty capable anyways, so I'm sure you'll survive the last 2 shifts before you
leave.
<name = ""> She thinks for a moment, and you swear you see her eyes glaze over
for a second.
<name = "Barista"> "How about this. Give me a Dark Roast with Hazlenut, Mocha,
and extra soy milk - meaning more then 1 milk, if that wasn't clear."

<\BUBBLE>"I struggle to perform."
<name = ""> She frowns for a moment, though you can't tell if thats an actual
frown or if her face naturally looks unhappy.
<name = "Barista"> "Well clearly you're doing SOMETHING right, otherwise the
coffee shop wouldn't have lasted this long.
<name = ""> She wobbles for a moment.

<name = ""> She grabs the cup before catching herself from drinking it. She
looks at the contents with an almost crazy look in her eyes.
<name = "Barista"> "Yeah I can definitely tell that this is correct. The subtle
coloring and the aroma definitely FEEL right. Good work Jerry."
<name = ""> She hesitates a moment before setting the cup back down on the
counter.
<name = "Barista"> "Well. As we've agreed on, that's all I've got for you. I
wish you luck for these last two days, but I have to return home.
<name = ""> She wobbles back to the door, opening it up before getting knocked
over again on the return. This time, she doesn't get back up.
You sigh, pour out the coffee into the sink, and pick up the phone once more for
the ambulance.
Much like the first day, the arrival of paramedics causes you to have to close
the coffee shop for the remaining day.
So much for a successful last couple shifts.

she frowns and looks you in the eyes.
<name = "Barista"> "There's definitely something wrong with this. I'm not sure
how you managed it, but the coffee is just...wrong. Whatever, this is just
protocol anyways, I'm not drinking this, and I'm going home."
