<\BUBBLE>START
@Day 3@
You wake up to an all too familiar ceiling - the cafe.
I suppose working for 4 shifts in a row without going home or sleeping would
tire you out, and eventually your body would be forced to sleep. Nothing a
little coffee can't fix.
Judging from the sunlight outside, you surmise that it's Day 3 of running the
new branch. That means you're half way done!
You walk over to the door and flip the sign to read "open" before moving back to
behind the counter.
Theres the occasional customer that comes in, and business goes rather smoothly.
As you're cleaning up, the door opens and a new customer strolls up to the
counter.

side of the Cafe, before a propeller appears from its top and it flies away.
What a strange encounter.

his lips.
<name = "Gramps">"You see, it's my dog Benedict. I got up one day and he was
nowhere to be found. I suppose its foolish to ask, but you wouldn't have

<name = "">The old man narrows his eyes before looking directly at you.
He reaches into his coat pocket and removes a large pocketwatch, before putting
it away.
He takes the drink, taking a moment to smell it, curling his lip in distaste,
before bringing it to his lips.
<name = "Gramps">"This isn't what I ordered but I'll let it slide since you seem
like a good kid. Now. Onto brass tacks. I'm currently lookiing for my dog,
Benedict, as it seems as though he's wandered off somewhere. You wouldn't have
happened to see him, would you?"<choice>

The dog begins to aggressively drink the glass of water before looking back up
at you
<name = "Benedict">"That does indeed hit the spot."
"I must say, your face does betray some form of puzzlement. Is something the
matter?"<choice>

The dog says(?) nothing but you can tell from the way its fur is standing up
that its not happy.
A small growl is heard before what could be called a mumble is spoken:
<name = "Benedict">"Guess I should have figured. This industry is done for if I
can't even get a glass of water right."
<name = "">The dog gets up and begins walking out of the cafe. As soon as it
does, you feel your knees give out and you stumble behind the counter.
Regaining your balance, you find the dog nowhere to be seen.

You feel like you've met this individual before but you can't seem to remember
where.
<name = "???">"Hiya, could I get a Latte? You can put the name "Cien" on the
cup."
<name = ""> You begin to make the latte, but before you actually get to add any
ingredients, Cien stops you.
<name = "Cien"> "Could the latte leave out anything with THIS letter in them?
Sorry, it's just a personal preference."
<name = ""> Cien hands you a slip of paper with the letter "K" scribbled
hastlily on it. Weird. Alright, so that rules out using Milk, and Dark Roast.
How you're meant to make a latte without milk is definitely difficult, but not
the most outlandish order you've recieved.
As you begin to prepare the drink, you notice Cien staring intently at you.

<\BUBBLE>"Is something the matter?"
Cien looks surprised for a moment before collecting himself
<name = "Cien"> "No not at all. Just very interested in the coffee-constructing
procedure. Although now that you mention it, I did find it strange that you
didn't question my distaste for words with THAT letter in them."
[["The letter K-" |<\BUBBLE>"The letter K-"]]
<\BUBBLE>"Have we met before?"
Cien looks you up and down for a moment, pondering the thought before speaking.
<name = "Cien"> "No, I think I'd remember someone as... unique... appearing as
you. Your name is probably along the lines of Jerry right? I don't think I am
familiar with any Jerrys.
<name = ""> Before you can correct to ANOTHER PERSON that your name (probably)
isn't Jerry, Cien interupts you.
<name = Cien> "Oh yeah, I meant to ask. You don't seem very interested in the
story behind my distaste of THAT letter"
[["The letter K-" |<\BUBBLE>"The letter K-"]]
<\BUBBLE>"The letter K-"
<name = "Cien">"YES YES THAT letter."
"Let me spin you a tale.. It was about 7 days ago. I was having a coffee at a
certain coffee shop (the old branch), having a grand old time. It was then that
a CREATURE appeared through a hole in the floor. Now normally I wouldn't care
that much, but it tried to order coffee like it DIDNT just punch a hole through
the floor. One thing lead to another and I barely escaped with my life."
"That incident could only be attributed to things starting with THAT letter,
hence the distaste."
<name = ""> Gotta love the random infodump by some random stranger.
<name = "Cien"> "Oh yeah hows my order coming along?"

<name = ""> You hand Cien the Latte, to which he takes a second to look at it
before taking a sip.
<name = "Cien"> "Cool, thanks!"
<name = ""> Cien hands you the money for the drink before leaving the cafe. Upon
stepping outside, his form seems to shimmer for a moment before he dissolves.
People don't generally tend to do that, but hey at least he actually paid you.

<name = "">
Cien takes the drink, examining it close before taking a sip. His disgust is
visible but he tries to hide it.
<name = "Cien"> "This is definitely...something. Did you by any chance use an
ingredient that had THAT letter in it?"
"Sorry, but could you remake this? I don't know if I can stomach much more."
