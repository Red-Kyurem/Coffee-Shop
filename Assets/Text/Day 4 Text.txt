<\BUBBLE>START
@Day 4@
Walking back through the entrance, it's Day 4!
You flip over the sign once again, taking your position behind the counter as
usual.
After a couple minutes, some customers start to arrive, though they were so
normal that you can't quite recall any of their faces.
For the first time this week, the cafe actually seems lively, so much so in fact
that it makes you wish your coworker wasnt hospitalized.
The surge in activity seems to die down around noon, with the cafe returning to
its normal state, with a couple customers every couple of minutes.
Eventually, you get a break in the action which you take as an opportunity to
clean everything up, washing the cups and getting into the coffee machine.
After cleaning up a cup that was stained with oil, you turn back towards the
counter and see a familiar face.
<name = "Gramps"> "Ah yes hello my friend. It is so very good to see you once
more.
<name = ""> Gramps has returned.
[["Gramps!"|<\BUBBLE>"Gramps!"]]
<\BUBBLE>"Gramps!"
Gramps seems much happier since you last saw him on Day 2, taking the
opportunity to stretch his arm across the counter and shake your hand.
<name = "Gramps"> "I thought I would drop by once more since it has been oh so
long since I've been here."
<name = ""> He takes a moment to compose himself before he clears his throat.
<name = "Gramps"> "I've just been in the most glorious moods recently, though
I'm not sure why... it must have been the coffee you served me! I kid of course,
but I will admit I did find myself wanting to come back for another drink. You
do remember what I ordered last time right? <choice> 
[["Of course I remember - it's only been 2 days." |<\BUBBLE>"Of course I remember - it's only been 2 days."]]
[["Sorry sir, can't say I do" |<\BUBBLE>"Sorry sir, can't say I do"]]
<\BUBBLE>"Sorry sir, can't say I do"
Gramps chuckles
<name = "Gramps"> "Ah, well I wouldn't expect you to. My order was Decaf with
Hazelnut, though this time I would ask that you add 2% Milk on top of that,
since I found it was a little too bitter last time.
<name = ""> The change in order surprises you, as you assumed that Gramps was
fine with the bitterness. Oh well, adding 2% Milk to the order isn't that big a
deal.

<\BUBBLE>"Of course I remember - it's only been 2 days."
Gramps chuckles.
<name = "Gramps"> "You surprise me! I was joking about you remembering the
order, since I saw how busy it was this morning it would be silly for you to
remember some old man's order.
<name = ""> You think for a moment on what Gramps' order was back from Day 2...
If you remember correctly it was a Decaf with Hazelnut.
<name = "Gramps"> "If I could make one altercation to the old order, could I
request that you also add 2% Milk? I felt like the order last time was a little
bitter for my tastes."
<name = ""> The change in order surprises you, as you assumed that Gramps was
fine with the bitterness. Oh well, adding 2% Milk to the order isn't that big a

<pauseDialouge> <toggleHide> Gramps takes the drink, smelling it for a moment before taking a sip.
He closes his eyes, taking in the flavor.
<name = "Gramps"> "Outstanding work. You've simply outdone yourself this time."
<name = ""> He puts the drink down before looking into your eyes.
<name = "Gramps"> "Do you remember what I asked you to do for me? About my dog,
Benedict? Have you seen him since I asked you to keep a look out?"
<name = ""> You nod.
<name = "Gramps"> "Ah good. Well if you've seen him then it means he hasnt fled
the country... You know what? I don't think I've ever actually told you why I
need to find Benedict so badly. So as you've no doubt pieced together, I own
Benedict. What this actually means is that I'm responsible for anything he does,
or should I say DOESN'T do."
<name = ""> He looks defeated for a moment.
<name = "Gramps"> "He...uh... didn't pay his taxes and now I'm dealing with the
consequences of his tax evasion.
<name = ""> ...
<name = "Gramps"> "..."
<name = ""> A sudden noise causes both of you to look towards the door. Bendict
has arrived.
<name = "Gramps"> "BENNY, ITS TIME TO PAY YOUR TAXES!"
<name = ""> Gramps breaks into a sprint towards Benedict, the latter of which
turns to run away, causing both of them to exit the cafe.
Well, at least they're reunited...sorta.

<pauseDialouge> <toggleHide> Gramps smells the cup for a moment, raising an eyebrow suspiciously before
taking a sip.
<name = "Gramps"> "Hmmmm..."
<name = "You"> "Is something the matter?"
<name = "Gramps"> "Its the drink. Somethings...off... about it."
<name = ""> You surmise you messed up somewhere. Maybe you missed an ingrediant?
Gramps furrows his brow for a moment before putting the cup down.
<name = "Gramps"> "Ah whatever. Mistakes happen. There's always next time. More
importantly.... do you remember what I asked you to do last time? With my dog,
Benedict? Did you keep a look out for him as I asked?
<name = ""> You nod.
<name = "Gramps"> "Ah good. Well if you've seen him then it means he hasnt fled
